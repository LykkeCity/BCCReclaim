The GUI to use for signing/broadcasting the Bitcoin cash Reclaim transaction. It was intended both from private wallet and trading wallet. The private wallet parts read blockchain until split and generates the spending transaction, and contacts the server to broadcast the transaction. The trading wallet (which requires both Lykke and client signatures) has not been further developped because of project stop. Signing result is available from TxSigner project, and currently there are defferent ideas about how to integrate the results to get it signed by the client, including embedding all transactions to the client app, geting it using an API and getting it through support. Each idea would have its own implementation.
